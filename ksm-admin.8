.TH KSM-ADMIN 8 "20 Jun 2012"
.SH NAME
ksm-admin \- KSM info and control utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBksm-admin\fP {start|stop|status [-f]|flush|millisecs m|scan p|help}
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBksm-admin\fP helps the system administrator know about KSM usage in the local machine.

KSM uses sysfs files at /sys/kernel/mm/ksm with weird names. With ksm-admin, all info is condensed and friendly readable.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fBstart\fP
start KSM by doing "echo 1 > /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/run"
.TP
\fBstop\fP
stop KSM by doing "echo 0 > /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/run" The 'stop' command doesn't clean cached pages.
.TP
\fBstatus [-f]\fP
Show KSM data and info. The '-f' option shows data in continous mode (similar to `\fBtop\fP').
.TP
\fBflush\fP
stop KSM by doing "echo 2 > /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/run". The 'flush' command \fIremove all\fP cached data!
.TP
\fBmillisecs m\fP
Set to 'm' millisecs the time between scans, doing "echo m > /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/sleep_millisecs". A possitive integer is spected.
.TP
\fBscan p\fP
Set how many 'p' pages to scan between each sleep, by doing "echo p > /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/pages_to_scan". A possitive integer is spected.
.TP
\fBhelp\fP
Show help, version and usage.
.SH ABOUT
Resume messages are only orientative. KSM takes long time to start working well (to start being efficient).

The RAM and SWAP usage are the system total RAM and SWAP usage (result of consulting `\fBfree\fP' command).
