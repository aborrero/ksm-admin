ksm-admin - KSM info and control utility
Licensed under GPLv3, readable at: 

USAGE
	ksm-admin {start|stop|status [-f]|flush|millisecs m|scan p|help}

DESCRIPTION
	ksm-admin helps the system admin know about KSM usage in the system.

	KSM uses sysfs files at /sys/kernel/mm/ksm with weird names. With ksm-admin, all info is condensed
	and friendly readable.

OPTIONS
	start
        start KSM by doing "echo 1 > /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/run"

	stop
	stop KSM by doing "echo 0 > /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/run" The 'stop' command doesn't clean cached pages.

	status [-f]
	Show KSM data and info. The '-f' option shows data in continous mode (similar to `top').

	flush
        stop KSM by doing "echo 2 > /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/run". The 'flush' command remove all cached data!

	millisecs m
	Set to 'm' millisecs the time between scans, doing "echo m > /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/sleep_millisecs".
	A possitive integer is spected.

	scan p
	set how many 'p' pages to scan between each sleep, by doing "echo p > /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/pages_to_scan".
	A possitive integer is spected.
	
	help
	Show help, version and usage.

ABOUT
	Resume messages are only orientative. KSM takes long time to start working well.
	The RAM and SWAP usage are the system total RAM and SWAP usage (result of consulting `free' command).
